#' @title RIF/CIF File Conversion to TIFF
#' @description
#' Converts and subsets RIF or CIF files to TIFF.
#' This function is experimental.
#' @param fileName path of file to subset.
#' It has to be a '.rif' or '.cif' file.
#' @param write_to pattern used to export file.
#' Placeholders, like "\%d/\%s_fromR.\%e", will be substituted:\cr
#' -\%d: with full path directory of 'fileName'\cr
#' -\%p: with first parent directory of 'fileName'\cr
#' -\%e: with extension of 'fileName' (without leading .)\cr
#' -\%s: with shortname from 'fileName' (i.e. basename without extension).\cr
#' Exported file extension has to be .tif or .tiff.
#' @param objects integer vector, IDEAS objects ids numbers to use. If missing, the default, all objects will be used.
#' @param offsets object of class `IFC_offset`. If missing, the default, offsets will be extracted from 'fileName'.\cr
#' This param is not mandatory but it may allow to save time for repeated XIF export on same file.
#' @param fast whether to fast extract 'objects' or not. Default is TRUE.
#' Meaning that 'objects' will be extracted expecting that 'objects' are stored in ascending order.\cr
#' Note that a warning will be sent if an 'object' is found at an unexpected order.
#' In such a case you may need to rerun function with 'fast' = FALSE.
#' If set to FALSE, all raw object_ids will be scanned from 'fileName' to ensure extraction of desired 'objects'.\cr
#' IMPORTANT: whatever this argument is, features are extracted assuming an ascending order of storage in file.
#' @param endianness The endian-ness ("big" or "little") of the target system for the file. Default is .Platform$endian.\cr
#' Endianness describes the bytes order of data stored within the files. This parameter may not be modified.
#' @param verbose whether to display information (use for debugging purpose). Default is FALSE.
#' @param verbosity quantity of information displayed when verbose is TRUE; 1: normal, 2: rich. Default is 1.
#' @param overwrite whether to overwrite file or not. Default is FALSE.\cr
#' Note that if TRUE, it will overwrite exported file if path of 'fileName' and deduced from 'write_to' arguments are different.
#' Otherwise, you will get an error saying that overwriting source file is not allowed.\cr
#' Note also that an original file, i.e. generated by IDEAS(R) or INSPIRE(R), will never be overwritten.
#' Otherwise, you will get an error saying that overwriting original file is not allowed.\cr
#' @param display_progress whether to display a progress bar. Default is TRUE.
#' @param add_tracking whether to register files' paths and objects' ids in the exported file. Default is TRUE.
#' @param ... other arguments to be passed.
#' @details This function is experimental and under development inputs and outputs may change in the future
#' @return It invisibly returns full path of exported file.
