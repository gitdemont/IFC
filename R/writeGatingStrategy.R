#' @title Gating Strategy File Writer
#' @description
#' Writes Gating Strategy from an `IFC_data` object to a xml file
#' @param obj an `IFC_data` object extracted with features extracted.
#' @param write_to pattern used to export file.
#' Placeholders, like "\%d/\%s_fromR.\%e", will be substituted:\cr
#' -\%d: with full path directory of 'obj$fileName'\cr
#' -\%p: with first parent directory of 'obj$fileName'\cr
#' -\%e: with extension of 'obj$fileName' (without leading .)\cr
#' -\%s: with shortname from 'obj$fileName' (i.e. basename without extension).\cr
#' Exported file extension will be deduced from this pattern. Note that it has to be a .xml.
#' @param overwrite whether to overwrite file or not. Default is FALSE.
#' @param display_progress whether to display a progress bar. Default is TRUE.
#' @param verbose whether to display information (use for debugging purpose). Default is FALSE.
#' @param ... other arguments to be passed.
#' @return It invisibly returns full path of exported file.
