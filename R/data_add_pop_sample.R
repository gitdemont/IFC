#' @title Population Sampling
#' @description
#' Creates a sample from a population
#' @param obj an `IFC_data` object extracted by ExtractFromDAF(extract_features = TRUE) or ExtractFromXIF(extract_features = TRUE).
#' @param pop name of the population to sample.
#' @param size a non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose.
#' @param new_name name of the exported population. When missing the default, a random name will be given.
#' @param random_seed a list of elements to pass to \link[base]{set.seed} or a single value, interpreted as an integer, or NULL to be used when 'add_noise' is set to TRUE. Default is NULL.
#' Note that NA_integer_ or list(seed = NA_integer_) can be used to prevent 'seed' argument from being passed to \link[base]{set.seed}.
#' @param ... Other arguments to be passed.
#' @details population is exported as tagged population.
#' @return an IFC_data object with sampled pop added.
