# NEWS
## 0.1.5
- CRAN resubmission

fix trailing slash NOTE in last CRAN submission

fix cpp_normalize which did not take into account force_range parameter

## 0.1.4
- CRAN submission

## 0.1.2.101 to 0.1.3.104
- for CRAN

preparing for CRAN release

use doi instead of url

modify some links that have moved

- Improvements to graphs

improve drawing speed due to internal do.call that causes subtitute(x) to cast all x values to character

speed gain thanks to dissociation between `IFC_plot` object generation from plot and stats production

create internal plot_stats() dedicated function for stats extraction

create internal plot_lattice() dedicated function for plotting (also rename convert_to_baseplot to plot_base)

create internal plot_raster() and rasterplot() + cpp/hpp underlying functions to allow plot rasterization for very fast 2D graph drawing

better legend positioning

additional use of " " to prevent heightDetails potential error

fix bug with plotGraph which was opening a dev to retrieve lattice par settings

fix bug with grouping and precision = "light" when number of displayed population was <= 1

transformations (axes + density) should now be provided as character and are matched against allowed names

- Improvements to FCS file I/O

add text_only parameter

speed gain thanks creation of internal cpp/hpp functions after code profiling

better handle files with extra keywords segment

fix fcs import for multiple files merging when no spillover can be retrieved + when they have exactly same features names

fix large fcs file export

add support to bad-formatted fcs files (with empty data offsets in header)

warn user on missing additional datasets (i.e. non empty $NEXTDATA)

- Improvements to DAF / XIF file I/O

fix progress bar bug when extracting images/masks offsets

fix bug with population stats computation when IFC_data object contains tagged populations whose obj are not logical (i.e. numeric or integer)

fix bug when applying gating strategy with no graphs

better control/coercion on files read/write notably for graphs

- Misc

internally improve file scan by using raw vector target rather than string

fix internal whoami() which was erroring on namespaced calls (i.e. with :: or :::)

improve ExportToReport selection argument to allow graphs to be passed as a matrix that defines report layout

export new BatchReport function

#### This leads to the following visible changes for the user
*transformations should now be provided as character and will be matched against allowed names*

*a new BatchReport function is exported*

*readFCS gains a new 'text_only' entry in 'options' argument to allow user to only extract TXT segment*


## 0.1.2.100
- allow to pass `IFC_data` object in writeIFC()

- now handle `levelplot`

- improve .fcs input / output internally

speed gain and better accuracy notably for files stored with DATATYPE "I"

can handle files with non R standard bits length (i.e. not 1,2,4,8)

fix bug with large PnR e.g. "4294967296" which resulted in NA

- don't send error on partial mask retrieval

#### This leads to the following visible changes for the user
*buildGraph gains a new 'densitylevel' entry in BasePop controlling `levelplot` when 'type' is "density"*

*when fcs is imported @IFC_date, @IFC_file, @IFC_fileName, @IFC_dataset, @IFC_version, and @IFC_FCSversion are automatically filled. $FIL is not filled if found. $CYT is not filled if found except if user requires it.*

*readFCS gains a new 'force_header' entry in 'options' argument to allow user to control if data offset(s) should be taken from header only*


## 0.1.2
- CRAN release

- add color-gradient based on 3rd feature in density plot + add this 3rd feature as subtitle

- fix issue with axis tick labels on Solaris (polygon edge not found (zero-width or zero-height?))

- fix issue in internal addText() and hpp_mark() when added text does not fit into image.

- allow stats export with data_to_DAF and daf creation from rif file reading

- make changes to num_to_string to optimize numeric to string conversion when exporting file

- fix bug with rif reading (ExtractFromXIF) that was also extracting not acquired channels

- fix images values retrieval in getImagesValues (only one channel was retrieved instead of all)

- handle "0" color value

- retrieve "EVmode" information with getInfo

- add experimental FCS reader / writer

- improve axes labels positioning

- modify how transformation instruction is parsed to allow for more transformations in the future

- apply STRICT_R_HEADERS patch for Rcpp and change PI to M_PI

- fix bug with base64id that was not quoted which could lead id to be truncated on space characters

- modify string_utils to better escape and recognize regions, populations and features names, particularly when they contain | or when names are constituted of repeated patterns

- add redefine_ family internal functions to allow images, masks, and features renaming and their propagation across upstream dependency

- add support to more XIF files thanks to new internal testXIF function that allow to identify files with no mask

- allow spatial correction directly from objectExtract thanks to the addition of spatial_correction parameter in objectParam

- new experimental internal function to convert XIF to uncompressed TIFF (+ underlying hpp/cpp functions)

- remove TILE support and only use STRIP in mergeXIF and susbsetXIF since it seems to never been used

- remove hard dependency on object number retrieved from first IFD in getIFD allowing to get IFDs from other files than RIF / CIF (i.e. TIFF)

- make decomp.hpp more robust to invalid nbytes, imgWidth, imgHeight, nb_channels input fix potential off-by-one issue that could cause buffer overrun in code although it should never be reached 

- new function to apply spatial offsets correction on images

- new function to retrieve ASSIST tests values

- fix bug in setting Raw Number features definition when using ExtractFromXIF

- add new color in allowed colors palette "Control" now matches "Gray81"

- fix bug that disabled styling edition of population "All"

- add maxpoints parameter in buildGraph to control the number of cells displayed in 2D graphs

- create experimental read/write/apply GatingStrategy family functions to save/retrieve gating strategy (association of regions / populations and graphs) with partial support for GatingML

- better compute graph dependency in data_rm_ family functions

- add adjust_graph parameter to control if graph should be removed or if it should be modified if possible

- improve getAborted to retrieve file path of aborted elements in batch

- fix bug in shiny progress bar which did not initialize with title / detail

- improve mergeXIF and subsetXIF functions (speed gain + no more dependency on seek for reading current position)

#### This leads to the following visible changes for the user
*data_to_DAF now allows to create daf file with statistics table*

*data_to_DAF now allows to create daf file from an `IFC_data` object extracted from a rif file*

*ExtractFromXIF does not extract channels that were not acquired anymore*

*getInfo returned object gains an additional `evmode` value*

*buildGraph gains a new `maxpoints` parameter*

*data_rm_ functions gain a new `adjust_graph` parameter*

*subsetOffsets and getOffsets returned object gain an additional `test` attribute*

*getInfo now returns `XIF_test` value in addition to former elements*

*objectParam gains a new `spatial_correction` parameter which when TRUE adds a 2 new columns, namely `spatial_X` and `spatial_Y`, to the returned data.frame in 'channels'*

*paletteIFC now maps Control to Gray81*

*axes display have been slightly changed to show labels at `pretty` positions when LinLog transformation is used*
