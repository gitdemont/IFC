## 0.1.7.xxx
#### work on TIFF (mainly dedicated to handle large files)

fix bug with offsets being bounded or converted to NA_integer. Offsets were stored as uint32_t in hpp/cpp and placed in Rcpp::IntegerVector and then converted with as.integer in R which makes them undesirably bounded to [-(2^31-1) : -2^31-1], i.e. **max 2GB files**):

- In hpp/cpp we now use std::size_t to access files at desired position and store offset in Rcpp::NumericVector and in R, we remove the as.integer conversions,

- current IFD offset serves as reference for next computed offsets which are supposed to be greater than this reference (except for 0x00000000 last one) and next offset (for IFD or eventual extra content) are computed accordingly,

- order of images files export has changed due to the fact that current IFD serves as reference for new offset computation. Previously, extra content was written before IFD. Now, IFD is written first and then content that does not fit within the 4 bytes slot for value is written just after the offset pointing to next IFD.

improvement in offset extraction:

- dry code for hpp/cpp offset extraction,

- Now offsets are faster to extract, notably when initial number of objects is not known thanks to vector pre-allocation (before push_back was used),

- drop **RcppProgress** dependency. **RcppProgress** was used to monitor the extraction of offset within hpp/cpp. We now call internal **IFC:::setPB** from hpp/cpp function so all progress bars are now homogenized within `IFC`.

speed improvement during file export (**ExportToXIF**, **subsetXIF**, **mergeXIF**, **XIFtoTIFF**). Though it still remains long.

#### work on progress bar

improve logic (better mapping between value and steps).

using value < min in **IFC:::setPB** now allows for circular progress (i.e. pb restart at 0 and cycle once again and so on, until function stop). This way user can see that something is currently happening and not freezing. 

automatically detect shiny for progress bar.

drop dependency on **RcppProgress**

#### work on seed (make IFC as transparent as possible to RNG)

this is achieved thanks to new functions R/seed.R

1/ **fetch_seed** (ensures backward compatibility while allowing new behaviour).

2/ **with_seed** (encapsulates `expr` to allow its evaluation with seed while permitting RNG state to be reset once done)

- fully handle set.seed arguments (before only `seed` was passed and **NOT** `kind`, `normal.kind`, `sample.kind`),

- restore RNG state once done (before **set.seed(NULL)** was used on.exit),

- allow no modification at all by using `seed = NA_integer_`. It does nothing (no change, no restore), just R regular behaviour, so sequence keep going when a functions needs random generation.

For mask/features/regions/pops definition spliting or other internal stuffs alternative names needs to be generated. These alt names are created using random generation by **gen_altnames** that don't need to be statistically relevant. Consequently, they should not impact current R seed. `IFC` package has now been restructured to allow this. Internally, when **gen_altnames** is used, we use of "Mersenne-Twister", "Inversion", "Rounding" by default as it was the one used in old R version (at least since RNGVersion('1.7.0')).

To allow random and reproducible sampling based on a string, a new internal pseudo_seed() has been created to compute a seed integer from string. It is used with:

- pop or region name to pick its style/color randomly and reproducibly,

- graph dimension(s) to show only a random but reproducible subset of points,

- pop$def to decompose boolean population and create necessary intermediates for GatingML.

fix potential bug with **writeGatingStrategy** where random ids are generated to enable boolean population decomposition and export to GatingML (ids may have been duplicated ?).

encapsulate **requireNamespace("shiny", quietly = TRUE)** within with_seed (calling **requireNamespace("shiny", quietly = TRUE)** alters R seed).

make use of `rng = false` attribute for cpp functions export when possible.

#### work on stats

fix stats computation with infinite value.

fix stats in 2D (subset by dimension and not using both dimensions).

simplify internal **StatsReport**.

handle several edge cases:

- add specific behaviour for sd(numeric(0)) or sd(numeric(1)),

- var behaves as sd and improve NaNs count computation,

- return NaN when pop is of length 0 or when all feature values are NA (except for NaN count),

- return NaN instead of NAs.

allow to display progress bar.

return more statistics in **extractStats**.

#### work on graphs

add `backend` argument to **plotGraph**, **ExportToReport**, **DisplayReport**, **BatchReport** to allow to choose which backend will be used for drawing. Default `backend = "lattice"`, will behave as usual, while `backend = "base"` and `backend = "raster"` now allow user to use **base** graphics and further `backend = "raster"` to produce plots with huge amount of points very fast. `backend = "raster"` can also be used to generate reports of smaller size (which will open and render shortly).

**plotGraph** returned value `plot` element does not exist anymore and `par.setting` is now part of returned `input` element.

patch **buildGraph** to handle histogram plot extracted from rif files. In rif, population from graphRegion are used in `order` which is not compatible with what **IFC** needs, so `order` is modified if provided to remove these population names.

fix population order in legend (plot_base and plot_raster, not exposed before backend introduction)

**adjustGraph** (internal) be less permissive, ensure that features, transformations and types are respected (before only checks for existing pops and regions was performed). In addition, title should be recomputed when BasePop has changed. Finally, use it in **applyGatingStrategy** to ensure that plot can be produced when strategy is applied.

#### work on pops

allow propagation of attributes (notably, "reserved" used by `IFCshiny`).

add checks in **popsWithin** for recursive definition and for non duplicated names.

fix **popsRename** so as to handle graphs title.

allow 'base' modification in **data_modify_pops** + add needed graphs adjustments.

#### bugfix

in **autoplot**, when drawing a region requires the creation of a population.

non-finite values when computing combined features should be NaN.

stats computation with infinite feature values and bad subsetting in 2D graphs (subset by dimension and not using both dimensions).

in **popsRename* fix edge cases of renaming pops (e.g. swapping pop1 <-> pop2), fix GraphRegion (if any) which were not correctly computed, and fix to handle graphs title.

in **buildBatch**, exported files names computation when input files are not .rif.

fix bug that prevented file from being released when an error did raise during reading at hpp/cpp level.

allow for reading large files at hpp/cpp level by using std::size_t instead of uint32_t for offset positions (in scan.hpp and decomp.hpp, in addition to tiff.hpp).

potential bug with **writeGatingStrategy** where random ids are generated to enable boolean population decomposition and export to GatingML (ids may have been duplicated ?).

#### Misc

**data_add_pop_sample** (internal), don't set new_name automatically if missing and force user to provide one.

**redefine_obj**,  list only once duplicated names, use new_feat_def for mapping "to" and obj for "initial".

add (internal) **data_modify_regions** and **data_modify_pops** functions.

remove hpp/cpp_fast_cbind_functions which are not used anymore.

**data_to_DAF** now makes use of **toBIN_features** and **toBIN_images** internal functions.

order of images files export has changed. Previously, extra content was written before IFD. Now, IFD is written first and then content that does not fit within the 4 bytes slot for value is written just after the offset pointing to next IFD (see work on TIFF).

typo, missing param in toBIN_.* functions and UNDIFINED in getIFD.

#### This leads to the following visible changes for the user
* See the bugs fix above

* **IFC** package has a new dependency to **gridGraphics**

* **plotGraph**, **ExportToReport**, **BatchReport** functions now have a new `backend` argument

* **plotGraph** returned value `plot` element does not exist anymore and `par.setting` is now part of returned `input` element

* Functions using `random_seed` will now be used with with_seed (see work on seed)

* Large files can now be used (though, still restricted to 4GB on 32bit OS)

* When exporting XIF files order of extra content and IFD has changed (see work on TIFF)

* **RcppProgress** is not used anymore and `display_progress = TRUE` for offset extraction now calls the same progress bar system as all the other progress bars used within IFC package


## 0.1.7
- CRAN submission

## 0.1.6.xxx

- Redefine (Internally)

improve and document logic behind **switch_channel** (used to allow changing all images/masks/features definition of one channel to another one)

create **swap_channel** function (which use **switch_channel**) to operate channel swap (basically, switch to one channel, switch to other channel, and merge)

- Definition Parsing (Internally)

Internally, the framework used for parsing definitions (features/pops/masks) has been consolidated to enhance accuracy and security. This is mostly based on **splitn** (for pops and features) which split definition into chunks according to allowed names and operators and ensure 1-to-1 replacement of them with unique random names created thanks to **gen_altnames** and **random_name**

create dedicated **gen_altnames** function to map allowed names to unique id

adapt **splitn** to handle features definition, simplify logic, make use of **gen_altnames** ancillary function, and avoid unnecessary unique id creation thanks to new `alt_names` argument and add `scalar` and `dsplit` arguments

add dedicated **split_feat** (based on **splitn** and **get_altnames**) for features to avoid repeated splitting loop

- Features (obj$features, in `IFC_data` object)

create **featureIFC** for static features types/names (used to validate definition and also determine name of a feature)

create **gseq**/**cpp_seqmatch** to match string sequence, used by **feature_namer**

modify **feature_namer** (used to determine name of a feature)

"combined" features resulted in wrong values when extracted (dedicated internal **get_feat_value** and **getFeaturesValues** are now here to solve this)

**data_rm_features** caused the removal of more features than it should (due to wrong pattern used for features names matching)

- Populations (obj$pops, in `IFC_data` object)

fix potential bug with NAs / NaNs values, e.g. when graphically defined on features containing NAs / NaNs, the resulted event should be 'FALSE' and not 'NA' to flag that it does **NOT** belong to the population

limit the scope of evaluation for features and populations computation

adding/exporting "tagged" population containing NAs / NaNs value is not allowed

warning/error messages are now more informative during population add/compute/export

- Stats

improve and dry code for stats extraction / computation

group internal **buildStats** and **statsCompute** functions into **buildStats**

- Graphs

catch errors in density computation for histogram and send warning instead but allow graph to be created as far as possible (already catched in **plot_lattice** but not with **plot_base** nor **plot_raster**)

swap labels and symbols when using **plot_lattice** to gain in homogeneity with **plot_base** and **plot_raster**

"histogram" legend were ok for **plot_lattice** but not for **plot_base** and **plot_raster** which were displaying `pch` instead of `lty`

'NA' is now an allowed value for `adjust_graph` argument in **data_rm** functions to force graph(s) removal

implement and export new **data_add_graphs** **data_rm_graphs** functions

**adjustGraphs** now internally uses graph as intput rather than indice(s) of graph(s) from `IFC_data` object (which is more versatile and allows for testing any graphs in the context of 'obj')

catch error in **adjustGraphs**

fix bugs when trying to adjust graph in several places

1 - when testing if drawable which was not working since about https://github.com/gitdemont/IFC/commit/030df2bfb25680e3159aa4a15bf0d550543d4188

2 - when applied GraphRegion(s) result(s) in not found pop(s)

3 - when trying to applyGatingStrategy which did not actually test if graph(s) could be produced

fix bug in **plotGraph**, **ExportToReport**, and **BatchReport** in feature summary computation for graphs containing overlay of populations (1D and 2D) for values of the region(s) drawn

- Fix **objectExtract**

fix the fix https://github.com/gitdemont/IFC/commit/34f33de1f916673855c2bc69c0c1e686bd608c58 which did not allow to correctly pass extra parameters to dots ...

allow import/export of keywords

fix potential bug with extra keywords due to wrong regex identification

- Speed Gain

gray -> rgb color conversion improvement

use Rcpp::no_init when possible

modify internal **fastCbind** (the underlying hpp/cpp functions induced more overhead than R cbind)

- Misc

for progressbar, check if session missing and class rather than if length is 0

remove gc from fcs functions

allow to pass NULL and NA in **texttomatrix** / **addText** (before an error was thrown)

implement internal function **data_to_AST** to allow the creation of .ast file from `IFC_data` object

#### This leads to the following visible changes for the user

- XIF subset/merging

add `add_tracking` argument to mergeXIF, subsetXIF, XIFtoTIFF, and ExportToXIF functions to control whether exported file should contain tracking information

improve tracking of object_ID

improve XIF I/O speed (avoid conversion when building IFD and use raw instead thanks to new internal collapse_raw function)

- num to string

improve numeric to string conversion when using objects ids as names/dimnames (e.g. avoid 1e+05, use 100000 instead)

- population computation

create popsRename function to simplify population renaming in `IFC_data` object

fix bug with popsCompute for type "C" (combined) population computation when population definition contains repeated occurrence of same population name
