\usage{
getFullTag(IFD, which = 1, tag = "256", raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{IFD}{an object of class `IFC_ifd_list` extracted by \code{\link{getIFD}}.}

\item{which}{scalar, integer (index) or the name of 'IFD' sub-element to extract 'tag' from. Default is 1 to extract 'tag' from the first member of 'IFD'.}

\item{tag}{scalar, integer (index) or the name of the IFD[[which]] of the desired 'tag'.}

\item{raw}{whether to return tag as a raw vector. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
the full value of the corresponding IFD tag.
}
\description{
Retrieves full tag value from IFDs (Image Field Directory) extracted by \code{\link{getIFD}}.
}
\details{
It may be usefull to extract all information contained in a specific 'tag' since \code{\link{getIFD}} is designed to be run with argument trunc_bytes so as to only extract essential bytes to run faster and save memory.
Nonetheless, thanks to \code{\link{getFullTag}} users will still be able to get full extraction of specific tag.
