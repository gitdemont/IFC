\usage{
with_seed(
  expr,
  seed = NA_integer_,
  kind = NULL,
  normal.kind = NULL,
  sample.kind = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{expression to evaluate.}

\item{seed}{a single value, interpreted as an integer, or NULL, with the exception that NA can be provided to prevent passing 'seed' argument. Default is NA_integer_.}

\item{kind}{character or NULL. If kind is a character string, set R's RNG to the kind desired. Use "default" to return to the R default.}

\item{normal.kind}{character string or NULL. If it is a character string, set the method of Normal generation. Use "default" to return to the R default. NULL makes no change.}

\item{sample.kind}{character string or NULL. If it is a character string, set the method of discrete uniform generation (used in sample, for instance). Use "default" to return to the R default. NULL makes no change. Only applies on R version >= 3.6.0.}
